## Description

This mod gives you the option to disable the automatic cutting of trees.

In the game pawns automatically cut trees
- in growing zones
- under building structure blueprints
- when roofing a area

Especially with the ideology precepts of 'Tree Cutting' and 'Tree' this is very annoying, because pawns get a mood debuff from it.  

In this mod, you have six settings to disable the automatic cutting of trees:  
1. **Colonist**     
When one of your colonists gets a mood debuff from cutting trees  
-> Nobody will automatically cut trees.  
2. **Slaves**       
When one of your slaves gets a mood debuff from cutting trees  
-> Nobody will automatically cut trees.  
3. **Guest**        
  When one of your guest (temporary Colonist from quests) gets a mood debuff from cutting trees  
  -> Nobody will automatically cut trees.  
4. **Prisoner**   
  When one of your prisoner gets a mood debuff from cutting trees  
  -> Nobody will automatically cut trees.  
5. **ManualList**  
  All pawns with a mood debuff from cutting trees, get a extra Gizmo toggle button to add this Pawn to a manual list.  
  Gizmo only shows, when it has an effect. (When you have also the setting 'Colonist' activated, the Gizmo won't show on colonists)   
  When an alive pawn with mood debuff stands on this list.  
  -> Nobody will automatically cut trees.  
6. **General**  
  -> Nobody will automatically cut trees. (when someone wants more micromanagement)  

The mod has also a quick setting function to quickly toggle the above settings.  
In the bottom right corner of your screen you have a widget button, which opens a floating menu.  
This button can be disabled in the mod settings.
